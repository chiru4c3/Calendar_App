## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Modern web browser

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calendar-app.git
   cd calendar-app


2. **Install dependencies**

   npm install


3. **Start development server**

   npm start


4. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Build for Production

npm run build


## 📖 Usage Guide

### Creating Events
1. Click on any date in the calendar grid
2. Fill in the event details:
   - **Title** (required)
   - **Description** (optional)
   - **Category** (Personal, Work, Important, Other)
   - **Time settings** (all-day or specific times)
   - **Recurrence** (none, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
3. Click "Save Event" to confirm

### Managing Events
- **View Events**: Click on any date to see all scheduled events
- **Edit Events**: Use the edit button (✏️) in the event list
- **Delete Events**: Use the delete button (🗑️) with confirmation
- **Recurring Events**: Choose to delete single occurrence or entire series

### Navigation & Search
- **Month Navigation**: Use arrow buttons to move between months
- **Quick Access**: Click "Today" button to jump to current date
- **Search Events**: Use the search bar to find events by title or description
- **Keyboard Support**: Navigate using arrow keys and Enter

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### User Interface
- **Clean, Modern Design**: Minimalist approach focusing on usability
- **Color-Coded Categories**: Visual organization for different event types
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design with desktop enhancements
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG compliant with keyboard and screen reader support

### Technical Choices
- **React Hooks**: Modern state management without class components
- **CSS-in-JS**: Dynamic styling with theme support
- **LocalStorage**: Client-side persistence for offline functionality
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable components for maintainability

## 🔧 Development Decisions

### State Management Strategy
I chose React's built-in hooks over external libraries like Redux because:
- Simpler setup and maintenance
- Sufficient for the application's complexity
- Better performance for this use case
- Easier to understand and debug

### Styling Approach
Implemented CSS-in-JS for:
- Dynamic theming capabilities
- Component-scoped styling
- Better maintainability
- Responsive design integration

### Data Persistence
Used localStorage because:
- No backend required
- Instant data access
- Offline functionality
- Simple implementation

## 🧪 Testing
