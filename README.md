- **CSS-in-JS**: Dynamic styling with theme support
- **LocalStorage**: Client-side persistence for offline functionality
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable components for maintainability

## 🔧 Development Decisions

### Styling Approach
Implemented CSS-in-JS for:
- Dynamic theming capabilities
- Component-scoped styling
- Better maintainability
- Responsive design integration

### Data Persistence
Used localStorage because:
- No backend required
- Instant data access
- Offline functionality
- Simple implementation

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Edge (latest)

## 🚀 Deployment

This application is deployed on Vercel with automatic deployments from the main branch.

### Deployment Steps
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Configure build settings (auto-detected for Create React App)
4. Deploy with automatic SSL and global CDN

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- **React.memo**: Prevents unnecessary component re-renders
- **useMemo**: Caches expensive calculations
